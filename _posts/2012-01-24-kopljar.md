For all my French friends, for all the handball fans - this picture came as a result of the Croatian victory over the French. The best player of the game was Kopljar (his name would be translated as “spearman”), a guy with more than 2m in hight that has never ever played a good game. Till now, till today. His games were awfull, he’s 27 years old and has never had enough courage to shot, to jump, to make an attack as God wanted it. Until today when he played probably the best game in his life (previous and future altogether).
So, cheers mate, sorry for doubting in you! I wish you all the best and please, oh please, keep playing in that awesome way! ;)
