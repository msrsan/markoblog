Top Gear is coming to Croatia! 
Well, not literally but it’s not very far from that. Actually, Top Gear, season 9, is going to be aired on the Croatian National Television (HRT) from today on, appearing each Monday night. Hopefully, I predicted it right. 
I am sure most of you know what kind of show Top Gear is and why is it famous for, but for the rest of you, I’ll try to explain.
Top Gear is a BBC show and is one of the most viewed TV shows in the world, having more than 350 million viewers per week in more than 170 countries. The theme of the show are cars - sport cars, city cars, tractors, lorries, caravans, campers, etc. It is famous for it’s outstanding British humor and the non-conventional way of testing these cars. To get the hang of it, I recommend you to watch the show.
Croatian National Television (HRT2), 20,45, every Monday night. :)
PS - I am not a huge fan of Top Gear but I do like the show. Accidentally, I watched the Top Gear India special and I have to say it was really awesome. These 3 guys are going to India on a “trade mission”, promoting British (car) industries and running through all sort of problems and challenges. Here’s a trailer one and two to get the glimpse of it.
