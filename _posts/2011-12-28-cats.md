My first video post. Or to be precise, post about a video that is very funny, especially after 25th second. But also it’s a video about a cat. 
Ever since this social media frenzy came along and YouTube as a media started growing, there was always something about cats. No, I’m not a cat lover, I’m more of a dog fan, but I really have to admit, people really, really like cats - they film them, they post the video, pictures, even comics of cats. 
One of the signals that showed me how cats are really running their show was when I saw Ray William Johnson review cat videos. And, even though there was a dozen great videos, I really couldn’t understand what’s up with that?! 
So, this is my plea - people, calm down on the cat business. Take a picture, film or write about something else, there are a dozen million things out there :)
PS - Before writing this, I prepared myself mentally for all the cat-fans out there that are going to hate me right now.
