I know that this video is a Nikon commercial but I don’t care - it’s absolutely amazing. 
The adventures and the free spirit that are shown there are just great! People presented are doing the things they like, the things they were (obviously) born to do, enjoying every moment of it. That’s what life is meant to be, that’s what we are supposed to do, that’s what we have to tend to!
