SDRs or Sales Development Representatives send a bunch of messages and use a bunch of techniques to get in front of prospects and to get their attention. The idea is to use very tailored and personalised messaging based on the circumstance of what you are selling and providing and what I would need. 

Usually, you want to be in a position of a helpful advisor, you want to inspire and offer help and support. That builds a bridge of trust (that lacks due to a lack of relationship) and potentially lowers my guard to actually reply back and show some kind of interest.

On the other side, there are these types of emails. This has got to be the most cringe SDR outreach message I ever received.
