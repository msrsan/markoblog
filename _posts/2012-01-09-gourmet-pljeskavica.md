What you see and drool in front of you is called “gurmanska pljeskavica” or in the words of the true Englishman - “gourmet burger extra large”. To be precise, you can see three pieces. 
It’s trully large and the difference between an ordinary “pljeskavica” the “gourmet” is that this one is filled with cheese and sprinkled with bacon on top. Also, it’s a little spicy and it’s absolutely tasty! 
Keep whimpering :)
