After these two posts something was missing. The social interaction. 
I think of this blog as a place where two-sided conversations take place. Monologues and ex cathedra preaching is not the idea I had in mind. So, after a while, I made a decision and added a comment box below so that each and everyone of you can comment and share toughts, approval and disapproval.
As I am new here on Tumblr, maybe you can even re-post the post. Gotta check that one out.  
Anyway, comment away! :)
