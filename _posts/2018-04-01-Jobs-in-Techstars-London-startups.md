[Techstars London](https://www.techstars.com/programs/london-program/){:target="_blank"} has had ~60 companies that went through our programs from early 2013. Each company went through an intense selection process and 8-12 interviews and was eventually selected from a pool of more than a thousand companies on average. After, the company went through the intense 3 month program, some raised funding, some didn't. 

You can find all the companies that went through our programs [here](https://www.techstars.com/companies/){:target="_blank"} under the **London** classes (Classes 106, 78, 59, 46, 36 and 29). It is kept quite transparent, so you can see their status and funding history as well.
