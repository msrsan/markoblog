To say that I have been blogging was and is quite an overstatement. However, one of the things that I was particularly interested in is making it happen on the iPad rather than through the laptop. 

Back in 2018, with the help of Marija, I set up this blog on the [Jekyll platform](https://msrsan.com/Hello-World). On one side, Jekyll is great as it allowed the site to be hosted on Github. On the other side, Jekyll is and was sometimes a pain in the ass as I needed to go to Terminal, learn git and navigate through git commit, git push, git status, git add and various other commands. 

I care but I don't care that much. So, in order to avoid that, I Googled how other folks to it on their iPad where, technically, there is no Terminal. 

Thankfully, there were a bunch of people that described their journey, how they chose their apps and how their workflows work. For example, Mike depicted his [here](https://shellsharks.com/blogging-from-ipad) and Arthur depicted his (here)[https://sysless.com/updating-jekyll-blog-from-ipad/]. 

There are similar steps that both take: 
- writing a blog post on an iPad
- add and edit some kind of a visual
- add it to Github
- push it out into the world
 
So, that is pretty much what I did:
- I'm using 1Writer to write the draft blog post 
- use Working Copy to add the visuals to the right folder in the repository 
- use Working Copy to import the draft blog post
- use Working Copy to push it out

So far it works - let's see if this will improve my writing discipline.
