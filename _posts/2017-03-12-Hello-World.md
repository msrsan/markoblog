Welcome to my personal website, my blog, the small part of the Internet where I am sharing my thoughts and opinions about topics that come from the startup and VC world, productivity domain and random, fun and less fun domains. 

The name of the blog post is *Per Aspera Ad Astra*, do check out what that means and why I [chose it here.](per-aspera-ad-astra.html)

Oldest blog posts are from 2011 when I first started blogging on Tumblr (links to original posts included) and then transitioned to Medium before finally creating a dedicated website. Hence, if you actually do go back, you'll read the thoughts of a young man from Croatia who is still studying CS and Business and working for Netokracija and ZIP while founding his company on the side. As I grew up (did I?), thoughts became more structured and serious (did they?) and that can be easily detected. 

Topics I will mostly cover:
- VC / Startup
- Productivity
- Tech
- Random
