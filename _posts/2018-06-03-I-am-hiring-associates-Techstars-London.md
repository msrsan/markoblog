**Who are the associates?** 

Associates are people that come in during the Techstars Program and then work closely with the companies Techstars selected. As we want our companies to accelerate as fast as possible, Techstars hires associates to give that extra fuel. Associates would come from all kinds of backgrounds and would mostly fall under: Business Development, Marketing, Software Development and Design.

Associates will help build the next amazing batch of startups, as they grow from early stage to venture-backed companies. It’s basically a chance to hack the system and go through the program as Founders do, to get amazing experience, get real stuff done and broaden your network in ways you could never imagine, get exposure to some of the greatest up and coming companies and teams in Europe. 

Historically, most associates end up being employed by one of the teams or by someone they met during the span of the three months. Some go on to join other companies in our network, go on into the VC space or join even Techstars fulltime. Many also go on to build their own companies.
