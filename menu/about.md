![Marko](../assets/img/markosrsan.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}


I am a Program Manager at Techstars.

After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and spending an Erasmus semester abroad at ICHEC in Brussels, I obtained a Master's degree in Business at the University of Zagreb.

Even though I am a founder of TimePrep, an iOS time management app for CFA candidates, I worked as a Business development manager and a blogger for Netokracija, leading the organisation of a few 400, 500 people conferences and as an Organizer at the Zagreb Entrepreneurship Incubator. Eventually, I joined Techstars as an Associate in the London Winter 2014 program and became a Program Manager and successfully led Techstars London 2015, 2016 and 2017 cohorts.
