![Marko](../assets/img/msrsan.jpg){:class="img-responsive"} 

I am a Program Director at Techstars.

After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and spending an Erasmus semester abroad at ICHEC in Brussels, I obtained a Master's degree in Business at the University of Zagreb.

Even though I am a founder of [TimePrep](www.timeprep.me), an iOS time management app for CFA candidates, I worked as a Business development manager and a blogger for [Netokracija](www.netokracija.com), leading the organisation of a few 400, 500 people conferences and as an Organizer at the [Zagreb Entrepreneurship Incubator](www.zipzg.com). Eventually, I joined [Techstars](www.techstars.com) as an Associate in the London Winter 2014 program, became a Program Manager and successfully led Techstars London 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 cohorts while being promoted to a Director role in early 2018.
