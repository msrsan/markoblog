Welcome to my personal website, my blog, the little part of the Internet where I am sharing my thoughts and opinions about topics that come from the startup and VC world, productivity domain and random, fun and less fun domains. The name of the blog post is Per Aspera Ad Astra, do check out what that means and why I [chose it here.](per-aspera-ad-astra.html)

Oldest blog posts are from 2011 when I first started blogging on Tumblr (links to original posts included) and then transitioned to Medium before finally creating a dedicated website. Hence, if you actually do go back, you'll read the thoughts of a young man from Croatia who is still studying CS and Business and working for Netokracija and ZIP while founding his company on the side. As I grew up (did I?), thoughts became more structured and serious (did they?) and that can be easily detected.

I am a Program Manager at Techstars.

After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and spending an Erasmus semester abroad at ICHEC in Brussels, I obtained a Master's degree in Business at the University of Zagreb.

Even though I am a founder of TimePrep, an iOS time management app for CFA candidates, I worked as a Business development manager and a blogger for Netokracija, leading the organisation of a few 400, 500 people conferences and as an Organizer at the Zagreb Entrepreneurship Incubator. Eventually, I joined Techstars as an Associate in the London Winter 2014 program and became a Program Manager and successfully led Techstars London 2015, 2016 and 2017 cohorts.
